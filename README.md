# Super-Smash-Boas
Python Class project created by Harrison Teplitz, Kaustubh Lahiri, and Camilla Brady

To run, view and edit our code:
Go to the "Ready-To-Play-Farming-Game" branch and download all of the files. Our finalized code is in the file "farming_game.py".

To see our iterative process code:
Go to the "farming-game" branch. This folder contains all of the .jpg and .png files used in the code as well as multiple iterations of our code.

Play game without Python:
Follow this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O0IZw1UtzeA2n1xM5V7FOdt0g1k9RpjG/view?usp=sharing) to our Zip folder in drive. 
Download the zip then run the executable, farming_game.exe!

Note: Your antivirus and/or Windows Defender may flag this as a suspicious file when extracting the zip file because of the farming_game.exe file. Do not worry as this file is completely harmless and can be run without issue/threat to your PC.

Note 2: The executable currently only works in a Windows environment.
