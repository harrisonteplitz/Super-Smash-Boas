To run, view and edit our code:
Go to the "Ready-To-Play-Farming-Game" branch and download all of the files. Our finalized code is in the file "farming_game.py".

To see our iterative process code:
Go to the "farming-game" branch. This folder contains all of the .jpg and .png files used in the code as well as multiple iterations of our code.
