# Super-Smash-Boas
Python Class project created by Harrison Teplitz, Kaustubh Lahiri, and Camilla Brady

To run, view and edit our code:
Go to the "Ready-To-Play-Farming-Game" branch and download all of the files. Our finalized code is in the file "farming_game.py".

To see our iterative process code:
Go to the "farming-game" branch. This folder contains all of the .jpg and .png files used in the code as well as multiple iterations of our code.

Play game without Python:
Follow this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O0IZw1UtzeA2n1xM5V7FOdt0g1k9RpjG/view?usp=sharing) to our Zip folder in drive and 
download the zip then run the executable! You might have difficulty with your computer 
protection services allowing the file to run. You might also have to extract the files to a different folder before running.
